# Comments

 Application has some glitches on the front end. If you click “create a new note” icon on the right corner won’t let you to type in unless you refresh the page. It is happening if you click “create new note” after you clicked to view existing savings. The app itself sometimes slower than you expected due to localhost connection, and it takes time to react on your clicks. Overall Note Taker application very useful tool to create, save and delete notes.
